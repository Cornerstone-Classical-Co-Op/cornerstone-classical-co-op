# Cornerstone Classical Co-Op
This is the code base for the official website of Cornerstone Classical Co-Op.
This site uses the static website generator, [Astro](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/why-astro/).  

**Key features make Astro a good choice for this site are as follows:**
- Markdown-based content makes it easier for non-developers to change text and basic elements.
- Supports Typescript, which helps ensure greater normalization of code.
- Supports easy integration with major JS frameworks such as ReactJS and VueJS.
- and many more [listed here](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/why-astro/)...

## Requirements to Run
- **Node.js** - v18.17.1 or v20.3.0 or higher. ( v19 is not supported.)
- **Text editor** - VS Code with the Official Astro extension is recommended.
- **Terminal** - Astro is accessed through its command-line interface (CLI).
